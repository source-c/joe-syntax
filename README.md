joe-syntax
==========
JOE is a full featured terminal-based screen editor which is distributed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  JOE has been around since 1988
and comes standard with many Linux distributions.

JOE is being maintained by its original author Joseph Allen, plus all of
the people who send bug reports, feature suggestions and patches to the
project web site.  JOE is hosted by SourceForge.net and its source code is
controlled under Mercurial.

JOE leaks some syntax support (and mb some other usefull stuff) or has
outdated jsf files. May be I'll do a fork of Allen's repo and will try to
synchronize both. But not here and now. So this one is just a place to store
my own syntax highlighters for JOW.
